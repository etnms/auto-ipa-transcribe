# Auto IPA transcription


## Goals of the project
This project aims at creating a fast way to transcribe files in both the original languages and the IPA transcription. Moreover, besides creating .txt file, one of the main features of the app is to create and ELAN file with tiers (transcription and IPA transcription) for the associated file

## Features
- Can transcribe a file (speech to text) into a .txt document
- Can provide an IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) transcription into a .txt document
- Can automatically create an ELAN file, attach the associated file with it, and provide two tiers for each transcription

## Limits
At the moment the project focuses on English transcription only, mainly as a debugging option and as a way to implement basic features. More languages should be added ultimately.
## Stack used
- Python
